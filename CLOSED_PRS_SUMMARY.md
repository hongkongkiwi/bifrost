## Recommendations for Moving Forward

### High Priority Features to Reimplement
1. **Streaming Support** (PRs #3, #20) - If not already fully implemented
2. **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation** (PR #4) - API documentation
3. **MCP Integration** (PRs #7, #9, #12, #15) - Model Context Protocol support
4. **UI Interface** (PR #27) - User interface for Bifrost

### Medium Priority
1. **Qwen/Dashscope Provider** (PR #26) - Additional provider support
2. **Plugin System Enhancements** (PRs #11, #16) - Dynamic plugin loading
3. **Route Rules** (PR #19) - Routing configuration

### Low Priority
1. **Zerolog Logger** (PR #23) - Logging enhancement
2. **NPX Support** (PR #18) - Package execution support

## Next Steps
1. Review current `core/` implementation to identify which features are already present
2. Create new PRs based on current structure for missing critical features
3. Prioritize based on user needs and system requirements

## Notes
- Most conflicts arose from the repository restructuring where code was moved from root to `core/` directory
- Dependencies have changed (e.g., from `goccy/go-json` to `bytedance/sonic`)
- Some features may already be implemented differently in the current codebase
